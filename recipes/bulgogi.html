        Description 
    </h2>
    
    <p> This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. You can substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety. My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! Serve over rice. </p>
    <p> The pictures do it justice. </p>
